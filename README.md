This is a simple welcome bot using python, created just to send automatic welcome messages :D

## Note:
- You need to download the packages that are in the `requirements.txt` folder for the bot to work correctly.
  Use this on console:
  ```py
  pip install py-cord==2.4.1
  pip install NewFunctionsPYC==1.4.0
  ``` 
- This bot is using the **[py-cord](https://docs.pycord.dev)** library, not **[discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io)**. If you have the **[discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io)** library installed on your desktop, I recommend that you **uninstall** it and only use the **[py-cord](https://docs.pycord.dev)** library.
- Also check if you have **[python](https://www.python.org)** installed on your desktop.

If you want to place your bot on a host, I recommend that you place it on a host with **75Mb RAM** or more. These are the hosts that I recommend you use to host the bot:
- **[DisCloud](https://discloudbot.com)**.
- **[SquareCloud](https://squarecloud.app)**.
